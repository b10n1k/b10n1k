### You have landed in my code space. Take a look

i am _b10n1k_ and I am a QE in SUSE. 

Currently I work mainly on OpenQA relative stuff and most of my time is developing test modules for the os-autoinst-distri-opensuse. 2022 brings me in a new team, QE kernel and more specifically taking over HPC test suites.
That change comes after a great year with the Container team in SUSE, working on Public Cloud, MicroOS among others and beyond Containers of course.
 
My interests are not limited on the OpenQA space and in my free time i try to expand knowledge in specific areas or hack my system or contribute somewhere else which is in my interest at the moment. Thus, things you might find here is django projects, compilers or AI tools, scripts and config
